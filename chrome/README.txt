To install in Chrome:

Open Chrome browser.
Open the extensions page via settings. Or use the URL "chrome:://extensions".
Drag the ccautologout.crx file onto the page.
Confirm you want to add the extension.
Ensure CCollab Auto-logout extension is installed and enabled.

Note: Because the extension is unsigned, you might get warnings about it not being
from a trusted source, ie: Chrome Web Store.

Extension adds a little "CC" icon into your toolbar. Click it to access setup.
Local:
  Enable "Force logout if all CCollab tabs are closed" checkbox.
  Use the "Log me out now" button as a shortcut to log out as necessary.
